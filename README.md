# MonkeyTypeWriter2.0
My First Try with Genetic Algorithm and first post in github

I take inspiration from this Youtube video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zfeTw-uFCw

The project have no main fonction. I made unit test for some of my fonction. If you want to se it in action juste lauch the  
"testGenerationIteration()" function  in EnvironmentTest.java.

Fell free to make comment about my code. I'm always happy to learn something new.
